# Convolutional Neural Networks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
In this project we have trained the input data with three convolutional layers each of which has a filter size=3 and stride=1 and there are 3 fully connected layers.
Using the activation layer ReLu and running the model for 10 iterations(Epochs).
